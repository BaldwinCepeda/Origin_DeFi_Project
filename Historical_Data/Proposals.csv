Use the new swap capability of the OETH vault to convert 900 rETH to WETH, which would then be allocated to the Convex AMO strategy.

### Background

Until recently, OETH could not change the makeup of its underlying collateral beyond wrapping/unwrapping ETH and staking frxETH. Its yield-generating capability was at the mercy of whichever tokens were deposited by minters. For example, if only LSTs were deposited and no one ever gave ETH to the protocol, then we wouldn't be able to put our Convex strategy to use. Luckily, a good mix of collateral has been deposited.

Last week, an upgrade to OETH vault was deployed to allow the Strategists to swap collateral using 1inch. This feature was developed after an extensive analysis of different DEX aggregators. It also includes multiple security precautions to prevent the Strategists from swapping to any collateral that hasn't been whitelisted and prevents them from incurring substantial losses. See [the pull request](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dollar/pull/1559) for more details.

An initial swap will be conducted this week to convert 50 stETH into frxETH. The feature was tested thoroughly prior to deployment, but this small transaction will confirm that everything works as intended in the wild. The purpose of this proposal is to recommend the first meaningful swap to follow.

### Analysis*

### Reasoning
We're big fans of Rocket Pool, and they have been supportive of OETH. However, users are quite vocal about the fact that they are coming to OETH for higher yield. rETH is our lowest-earning collateral type. Swapping some of it for WETH (and subsequently allocating it to the Convex AMO) is the obvious way to maximize yield given our current set of whitelisted strategies.

OETH's other long-term primary value proposition is diversification. By holding OETH, users have exposure to a diversified set of the safest LSTs and farming opportunities. While this proposal would result in less diversification by reducing the protocol's already low exposure to rETH, the increased concentration would be on ETH itself rather than another LST. To the extent that OETH can be backed by ETH and generate a higher yield than LSTs and other aggregators, it should.","For,Against,Abstain",1688547600,1689152400,17626378

As the one of the premiere stablecoins in the industry, I believe it is imperative for $OUSD to exist not only natively for yield-generation on Origin Protocol, but also to be supported by various DeFi applications across multiple chains. 

For this, of course, we would need to generate a price oracle for the $OUSD token. After researching various oracle solutions to provide an on-chain price feed for the $OUSD, I realized it is difficult and that the oracles who provide support for $OUSD are limited. 

I was able to identify one highly reputable oracle which would be able to successfully provide a resilient, production-ready price feed for $OUSD upon request, which is DIA Data. 

Here are some key reasons why DIA Data is a strong choice in utilizing an oracle provider for the $OUSD token to be supported on various DeFi Protocols. 

**Transparency and reliability:** DIA Data is a decentralized platform that provides reliable and 100% transparent data feeds, with a strong reputation of success since 2018. Their data is verifiable, open-source, and up-to-date, which is crucial for making informed decisions in the DeFi ecosystem.

**Sourcing:** DIA’s asset data is sourced on the individual trade level directly from over 80 DEXs and CEXs, enabling them to support assets like $OUSD. Whereas other oracles mostly rely on a limited amount of asset’s price data from off-chain data from trusted third party sources, DIA gets its reliable trade data directly from the source. This enables them to support over 3,000 crypto tokens, which to my knowledge is the largest data library of any oracle.  

**Customizable data feeds:** DIA Data provides custom data feeds tailored to our specific protocol use case and needs. This flexibility will allow us to access the data in the format which is most relevant to our operations and ensure longevity in the ever-changing DeFi ecosystem. For example, a stablecoin price oracle need not update every 1 minute, because price fluctuations are limited, but instead it is more optimal to have a stablecoin price feed update per a specified deviation threshold. The parameters and assets held in these feeds can also be adjusted after the oracle is deployed, making our reliance on DIA’s oracles future-proof.

**Competitive pricing:** DIA does not charge for their oracles. The only cost they ask is to cover the gas costs of pushing the updates on-chain. Simply the operational expense of the oracle. 

By using DIA Data, we can ensure that the data we rely on for our decentralized applications and smart contracts is 100% transparent, credibly neutral, and verifiable. I believe that DIA Data's services will provide us with a competitive advantage in our industry with the provision of an $OUSD markets across various DeFi protocols, further improving the utility and visibility of $OUSD and the Origin Protocol.

If the community is interested in exploring this, here are the rough steps we would take:

1) Once enough interest is expressed, Origin Protocol will request an $OUSD price feed from DIA on the DIA Forum
2) DIA will deploy the $OUSD price feed for Origin Protocol
3) Origin Protocol will fund the gas wallet for covering the gas costs of the custom $OUSD oracle
4) Origin Protocol will share word of the $OUSD oracle through marketing channels, and leverage their existing ecosystem of partners as well as the DIA ecosystem to connect with DeFi protocols which are interested in using the $OUSD price oracle. 

This is a proposal to request an $OUSD oracle from DIA

There are two options on which to vote:
Option 1: YES – Create an $OUSD and create additional utility for $OUSD across various DeFi Protocols
Option 2: NO – Do not create an $OUSD oracle

Deposit 1% of OETH's collateral to the Morpho Aave strategy and the remaining unallocated WETH to the Convex OETH AMO strategy.

#### Background

On June 2, [a proposal was unanimously approved](https://vote.ousd.com/#/proposal/0xd60ab9126f9b3f68601b93aeaed22f89bd4136206c17d173f3c95f52f0416a7e) to allocate 660 WETH to Morpho Aave after the strategy was launched with an allocation of 57.2 WETH. On the following day, the Morpho team [announced](https://discord.com/channels/851206607324577823/851206607324577826/1113947239879028776) that they had paused the deposit function on their contracts due to a potential issue with their interest rate model. As a result, all OETH funds were withdrawn from the Morpho Aave strategy as a precaution. Based on continued discussions with the Morpho team, we have reason to believe that the vulnerability has been addressed and there is no clear and present risk to any new deposits.

#### Changing circumstances

Since the prior Morpho Aave allocation proposal was created, OETH's TVL has grown by 67% and the AMO strategy's share of the Convex pool has fallen to 78%. This means that the strategy is earning a smaller portion of the rewards generated for this pool. Meanwhile, the pool is still earning an APY of 11.01% as of today, which is significantly higher than what the Morpho Aave strategy is likely to generate anytime soon. The takeaway is that any WETH allocated to our Convex strategy will be more productive than it would be if allocated to Morpho unless the LP participation in Convex falls significantly.

#### Recommendation

I'm suggesting that we resume the Morpho Aave strategy by depositing 1% of OETH's total collateral (roughly 100 WETH) and then depositing all remaining unallocated collateral (currently 933 ETH) to the Convex OETH AMO strategy. If implemented today, this would result in the following balance of allocations for OETH:

- Convex: 42.65%
- Lido: 7.93%
- Rocket Pool: 27.92%
- Frax: 20.50%
- Morpho: 1.00%","For,Against,Abstain",1686531600,1686618000,17460406

This enables a yield source for our currently-idle WETH that is sitting in the vault dragging down our APY.
https://vote.ousd.com/#/proposal/0xdbb4a7dae2a642cf95c08c4b4c7c9ffbfaeddbdb01f0fd2a698f0d3e2fe5384f

The strategy was deployed this week and, after going through the 24-hour timelock, has received an initial allocation of approximately $100k worth of WETH. Everything is working as expected but there will be continued testing and verification that there are no surprises. After a 48-hour baking period, we will increase the allocation to a meaningful level.

Considering that the code for this strategy is inherited from OUSD where millions of dollars have been safely deployed for several months, I'm proposing that we immediately ramp up the WETH allocation to 10% of the vault value.

After the strategy has been live and earning for one week with a 10% allocation, I'm proposing that Morpho Aave become the default strategy for WETH. This will mean that all new non-LST deposits (ETH/WETH) will automatically be allocated to Morpho Aave. This would also enable automatic withdrawals from the Morpho Aave strategy anytime someone redeems OETH. Currently, we will need to maintain some WETH balance in the vault for redeems to function properly.

Overview
Flux Finance is a fork of Compound V2, with minor changes to support permissioned tokens such as OUSG, alongside permissionless tokens such as USDC. Stablecoin lenders receive the corresponding fToken, representing their right to reclaim the underlying stablecoin plus accrued interest. Positions are collateralized by OUSG, which is invested into Blackrock’s SHV ETF (with a small portion of USD and USDC for liquidity purposes).

Motivation
- Provide a complementary source of yield to the current OUSD yield strategies. Currently, ~70% of OUSD stablecoin positions are at Morpho, yielding below 3% without incentives. Flux provides a sustainable strategy that currently targets a 3.9%+ yield.
- Generate arguably the best risk-adjusted yield available in DeFi, with positions being collateralized by OUSG.

Projected Returns
Since launch, and without incentivization, stablecoin supply rates on Flux Finance have consistently outperformed Compound, Aave, Curve, and other major stablecoin lending protocols.
